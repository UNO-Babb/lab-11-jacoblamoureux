In my experiment, I attempted to to make the most efficient checker possible. to do this, I first increased the amount
of items he was able to do per minute, and decrease the amount of items the customers were able to take. This allowed him
to go much faster. however, this meant that he was going through customers extremely fast and his idle times were way up. 
I'm not paying him to just sit around. This meant my customers needed to be more efficient as well. By decreasing the amount 
of time it took shoppers to retrieve their items and making it so that customers came into the store more frequently, I 
made sure that my checker always had a near-constant stream of work to do. Now, the store could hypothetically be made more 
efficient with more checkers, but I believe that hard work builds character and if I can get by without paying multiple employees,
I will. I also added processing to show what the longest and shortest wait times were.
